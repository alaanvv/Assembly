# I don't know Assembly

<img width='40%' src='https://media.tenor.com/-wrmUJrUbeoAAAAC/emoji-disintergrating.gif'>

I just played [a game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/?gclid=CjwKCAjwxOymBhAFEiwAnodBLK_cJQZ8_PAB93PWwDDUWnwDWW6wIREAQII99SLPlPnojmw5HAfVrRoCLNMQAvD_BwE) about and found it funny,  
so I'll do useless stuff with it, because I'm an  
average **Dark Souls** enjoyer  
(I don't even know what is possible to do with it)

## Todo (when I can ToT)

- A compiler and a programming language (maybe in 2058)
- An app with a window (is it possible?)
- Something that can interact with dispositives (like in that emulator)
- My own assembler
- Get what commands are passing by my processor and modify it
