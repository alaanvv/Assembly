# I don't know assembly

I just played a game about and found it funny,  
so I'll do idiot things with it  
(I don't even know what is possible to do with it)

This repository purpose is only save my codes  
cuz I'm using a complex web emulator as a boomer  
and also I want to save it for later, like, when  
I learn something that can turn my 80 lines of  
assembly in 3
